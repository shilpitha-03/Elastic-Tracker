[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddecomp_basis.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "decomp_basis", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "decomp_basis" with
  any of the following names:

    decomp_basisConfig.cmake
    decomp_basis-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "decomp_basis" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "decomp_basis_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "decomp_basis" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
