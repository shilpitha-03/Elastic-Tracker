[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findign_rviz_common.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ign_rviz_common", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ign_rviz_common"
  with any of the following names:

    ign_rviz_commonConfig.cmake
    ign_rviz_common-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ign_rviz_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ign_rviz_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ign_rviz_common" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
